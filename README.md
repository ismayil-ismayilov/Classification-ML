This is a Machine Learning course project. It consists from two parts:
### Regression
The task is to apply various ML algorithms (see the rules below) to build a model explaining the traffic on one of the highways for one-hourly intervals based on the training sample and generate predictions for all observations from the test sample.

### Classification
The task is to apply various ML algorithms (see the rules below) to build a model explaining whether a particular person consumed cocaine in the last month based on the training sample and generate predictions for all observations from the test sample.

### Various algorithms
For each of the datasets compared 3 different ML algorithms.

### The performance of predictions aree based on:
    * MAPE for the traffic dataset
    * balanced accuracy for the drugs dataset
    
### Datasets
Both datasets are provided by the course instructor.
